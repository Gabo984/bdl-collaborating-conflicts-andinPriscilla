# Conflicts

**Instructions**
* As a class, set up a repository with a README file. In this file, you will create a class directory.
* Each student must clone the repository and add their name to the directory (on the master branch). Push the changes made to the repository. 
* Pull any new changes made to the repository and resolve any conflicts.
